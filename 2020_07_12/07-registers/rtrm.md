# RTRM: Reading The Reference Manual

I mentioned that the microcontroller has several pins. For convenience, these pins are grouped in
*ports* of 16 pins. Each port is named with a letter: Port A, Port B, etc. and the pins within each
port are named with numbers from 0 to 15.

The first thing we have to find out is which pin is connected to which LED. This information is in
the STM32F3DISCOVERY [User Manual] (You downloaded a copy, right?). In this particular section:

[User Manual]: http://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00063382.pdf

> Section 6.4 LEDs - Page 18

The manual says:

- `LD3`, the North LED, is connected to the pin `PE9`. `PE9` is the short form of: Pin 9 on Port E.
- `LD7`, the East LED, is connected to the pin `PE11`.

Up to this point, we know that we want to change the state of the pins PE9 and PE11 to turn the
North/East LEDs on/off. These pins are part of Port E so we'll have to deal with the `GPIOE`
peripheral.

Each peripheral has a register *block* associated to it. A register block is a collection of
registers allocated in contiguous memory. The address at which the register block starts is known as
its base address. We need to figure out what's the base address of the `GPIOE` peripheral. That
information is in the following section of the microcontroller [Reference Manual]:

[Reference Manual]: http://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00043574.pdf

> Section 3.2.2 Memory map and register boundary addresses - Page 51

The table says that base address of the `GPIOE` register block is `0x4800_1000`.

Each peripheral also has its own section in the documentation. Each of these sections ends with a
table of the registers that the peripheral's register block contains. For the `GPIO` family of
peripheral, that table is in:

> Section 11.4.12 GPIO register map - Page 243

We are interested in the register that's at an offset of `0x18` from the base address of the `GPIOE`
peripheral. According to the table, that would be the register `BSRR`.

Now we need to jump to the documentation of that particular register. It's a few pages above in:

> Section 11.4.7 GPIO port bit set/reset register (GPIOx_BSRR) - Page 240

Finally!

This is the register we were writing to. The documentation says some interesting things. First, this
register is write only ... so let's try reading its value `:-)`.

We'll use GDB's `examine` command: `x`.

```
(gdb) next
16              *(GPIOE_BSRR as *mut u32) = 1 << 9;

(gdb) x 0x48001018
0x48001018:     0x00000000

(gdb) # the next command will turn the North LED on
(gdb) next
19              *(GPIOE_BSRR as *mut u32) = 1 << 11;

(gdb) x 0x48001018
0x48001018:     0x00000000
```

Reading the register returns `0`. That matches what the documentation says.

The other thing that the documentation says is that the bits 0 to 15 can be used to *set* the
corresponding pin. That is bit 0 sets the pin 0. Here, *set* means outputting a *high* value on
the pin.

The documentation also says that bits 16 to 31 can be used to *reset* the corresponding pin. In this
case, the bit 16 resets the pin number 0. As you may guess, *reset* means outputting a *low* value
on the pin.

Correlating that information with our program, all seems to be in agreement:

- Writing `1 << 9` (`BS9 = 1`)  to `BSRR`  sets `PE9` *high*. That turns the North LED *on*.

- Writing `1 << 11` (`BS11 = 1`) to `BSRR` sets `PE11` *high*. That turns the East LED *on*.

- Writing `1 << 25` (`BR9 = 1`) to `BSRR` sets `PE9` *low*. That turns the North LED *off*.

- Finally, writing `1 << 27` (`BR11 = 1`) to `BSRR` sets `PE11` *low*. That turns the East LED *off*.
